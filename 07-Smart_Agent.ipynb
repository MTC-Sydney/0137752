    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",

However, there is no randomized controlled trial that demonstrated the efficacy of antiviral therapy against COVID-19 yet. More evidence-based knowledge is needed about what routine care practices we should apply to ameliorate symptoms of patients and fight COVID-19 pathology. There are over 133 ongoing registered clinical studies on TCM/integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and the pharmacological studies have suggested that Chinese medicine is effective for COVID-19 probably through its host-directed regulation and certain antiviral effects. Further extensive studies and clinical trials, including double-blind and randomized clinical trials, with a higher number of patients, are necessary to confirm the activity of these medicines. \\n<br><u>Sources</u>: <sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/litcovid/train.csv?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2023-11-29T01:50:59Z&st=2023-05-10T16:50:59Z&spr=https&sig=ZT7MLy%2BnlvAxUKKj5v0RwoWObXaab3gO4ec2%2Fci6iL0%3D\">[1]</a></sup>', additional_kwargs={}, example=False),\n",
