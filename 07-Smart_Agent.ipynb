    "- **Notebook 05**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",

       " AIMessage(content='Hidden Markov chains, also known as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), are statistical models that represent a system that transitions between hidden states over time, with each state being associated with a set of observable outputs. In an HMM, the underlying state sequence is a Markov chain, meaning that the probability of transitioning between states depends only on the current state and not on the previous states. The actual states of the system are hidden, and the observations are generated by a probabilistic process that depends on the hidden states. HMMs are used in various applications such as speech recognition, robotics, and bioinformatics.\\n<br><u>Sources</u>: <sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/0501/0501068v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2023-11-29T01:50:59Z&st=2023-05-10T16:50:59Z&spr=https&sig=ZT7MLy%2BnlvAxUKKj5v0RwoWObXaab3gO4ec2%2Fci6iL0%3D\">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href=\"https://demodatasetsp.blob.core.windows.net/arxivcs/0505/0505018v1.pdf?sv=2022-11-02&ss=bf&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2023-11-29T01:50:59Z&st=2023-05-10T16:50:59Z&spr=https&sig=ZT7MLy%2BnlvAxUKKj5v0RwoWObXaab3gO4ec2%2Fci6iL0%3D\">[2]</a></sup>', additional_kwargs={}, example=False),\n",
