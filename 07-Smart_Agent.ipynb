    "- **Notebook 02**: We loaded more information to the Search Engine this time using a CSV file with 52k rows/articles in index: \"cogsrch-index-csv\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer bu using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We used a Utility Chain in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",

Possible complications include acute kidney injury, coagulation disorders, and thromboembolism. Laboratory indicators of COVID-19 include lymphopenia, eosinopenia, elevated levels of white blood cell counts, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6), and ferritin. Risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity and death include comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, elevated levels of D-dimer, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10, and decreased levels of lymphocytes, CD3 cells, and CD4 cells. \n",
