    "- **Notebook 04**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",

These models are widely used in applications such as speech recognition, bioinformatics, and robotics.\\n\\nIn a second-order Hidden Markov Model (HMM2), the probability of a transition between two states at time t depends on the states in which the process was at time t-1 and t-2.
