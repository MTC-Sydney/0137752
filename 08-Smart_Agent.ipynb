    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We used a Utility Chain in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",

Gather necessary tools and materials\\nBefore you begin, make sure you have the following tools and materials:\\n- A new car battery\\n- Wrench or socket set\\n- Protective gloves\\n- Safety glasses\\n- Wire brush or battery terminal cleaner\\n- Baking soda and water solution (optional)\\n- Battery terminal protector spray (optional)\\n\\n### 2. Turn off the engine and ensure safety\\nTurn off your car's engine and make sure it's parked on a flat, stable surface with the parking brake engaged. Put on your protective gloves and safety glasses.\\n\\n### 3. Locate the battery\\nOpen the car hood and locate the battery. In most cars, the battery is located in the engine compartment, but in some models, it may be in the trunk or under a seat.\\n\\n### 4. Identify the battery terminals\\nCar batteries have two terminals: a positive terminal (+) and a negative terminal (-). The positive terminal is usually covered with a red cap or marked with a plus sign, while the negative terminal is typically black and marked with a minus sign.\\n\\n### 5. Disconnect the negative terminal\\nUsing a wrench or socket, loosen the nut on the negative terminal. Once the nut is loose, carefully lift the cable off the terminal and set it aside, making sure it doesn't touch any metal parts.\\n\\n### 6. Disconnect the positive terminal\\nRepeat the same process for the positive terminal. Loosen the nut and remove the cable, ensuring it doesn't touch any metal parts.\\n\\n### 7. Remove the battery hold-down\\nSome car batteries have a hold-down clamp or strap that secures the battery in place. Remove this clamp or strap using a wrench or socket.\\n\\n### 8. Remove the old battery\\nCarefully lift the old battery out of the car, keeping in mind that it can be heavy. Make sure to dispose of the old battery properly, as it contains hazardous materials.\\n\\n### 9. Clean the battery tray and terminals\\nInspect the battery tray for any corrosion or damage. If necessary, clean the tray and battery terminal clamps with a wire brush or battery terminal cleaner. You can also use a baking soda and water solution to neutralize any acid residue.\\n\\n### 10. Install the new battery\\nPlace the new battery in the battery tray, making sure it's oriented correctly with the positive\", additional_kwargs={}, example=False),\n",
